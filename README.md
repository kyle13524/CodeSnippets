# CodeSnippets

These are random pieces of code and school projects that I find show my knowledge of programming and understanding algorithms and problem solving.

Contents:

DR: 
This was my part of a multi-program application in Linux that uses IPC schemes to communicate with other processes and relay information
using semaphore control for shared files. It gets messages from a message queue sent from a "Data Creator" application and processes the information over a masterlist of information.

encodeInput:
This was an assignment using Linux and binary files to create Motorola S19 or Assembly records given binary input into the system.

Unity Player Controllers:
I set out with the goal to mimic the functionality of the player controller of a game I played called "Fiesta". The controller will offset the character from the camera dependent on the Input axes. It uses mechanim root motion to move the character. I have deffinitely improved my knowledge of controllers and player movement along with blend trees for animations.
