             HELP FILE
************************************

Proper usage: encodeInput <switches> ...

Valid Switches: 
-srec = print the record in s-record format
-i<inputfilename> = use the specified file as input
-o<outputfilename> = print record to specified output file
-h = help

Keep in Mind:
-If no "-srec" switch is provided, assumes assembly format
-If no input file is specified, assumes input from stdin
-If output file is specified, output is printed to file
-If no output file is specified but input is specified, it will create a file with the same name
-If no output file is specified and no input file is specified, it will use stdout
